# Open Throw

Welcome to Open Throw, OpenThrow is an open standard for 3d printing high quality yo-yos with a large core featureset.

  - makes designing your own yo-yo easy
  - Create remixed parts and reskinned parts for your friends or club and know that they will work as intended



## Why Open Throw?

Open Throw aims to be the best, easiest, and lowest-cost way to create a 3d printed yo-yo.

- **C, Half spec C, or Spec XS Bearing** - Supports three bearing types. C bearings can be used responsive or unresponsive without printing a second part!
- **Proprietary part Compatibility** - Easily upgrade from the openThrow Stem to FD Stem or Cabal guts without printing a new yo-yo.
- **Gap customization** - Three sizes of hub are available to start: +1mm +2mm +3mm which are named for how much wider they make the yo-yo.
- **Part retention** - A core feature of all openThrow elements is that they are held together and don't go falling all over the place.
- **Customize** - Add sidecaps with your club logo or make your own shells and recombine them
- **Print Profile** - OT2 prints outside edge up. This greatly reduces the need for support material and makes the cup look much nicer. The print profile included uses petg support interface which makes removing the support for the hub recess very easy.
